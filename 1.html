<h2>Bernie Sanders Shoots Down Another Presidential Bid</h2>
<image src="bernie.jpg" width="70%">
<p><a href="https://berniesanders.com/" target="_blank" title="Official Bernie Sanders">Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)</a> touted <strong>the success of his progressive movement</strong> in an interview with the Washington Post on Monday, but said <u>2020 would most likely be his last run for the presidency</u> and that another progressive will succeed him on the national stage.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Post’s Robert Costa, Sanders argued that his 2020 presidential run shifted the party to the left on many issues, and that his strength with young voters shows “the future is with our ideas.”</p>
<p>Sanders has no obvious successor, but a number of progressive politicians have been floated as standard bearers in future presidential races. Perhaps the most common name that comes up is that of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who rose to national prominence after unseating a powerful Democratic congressional leader and has amassed an enormous following on social media. But if she were to run in 2024, she would just barely meet the constitutional age requirement to be president.</p>
<p>Other possibilities include Ocasio-Cortez’s colleagues in the progressive “squad,” Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). More established figures mentioned include California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Jeff Merkeley (D-Ore.), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), and Sanders’ former 2020 rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner and former Georgia State Representative Stacey Abrams have sometimes been mentioned as long shot candidates to take up the progressive mantle.</p>
