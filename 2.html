<h2>Oil jumps more than 6% as Saudi Arabia pledges further production cuts</h2>
<image src="crude.jpg" width="70%">
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/oil-markets-crude-output-coronavirus-in-focus.html" target="_blank" title="link to article">Oil futures rose on Tuesday, boosted by an unexpected commitment from Saudi Arabia to deepen production cuts in June to help drain the glut in the global market that has grown as the coronavirus pandemic crushed fuel demand.</a></p>
<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures climbed $1.64, or 6.8%, to settle at <strong>$25.78 per barrel.</strong> Brent crude futures climbed 35 cents, or 1.18%, to settle at $29.98 per barrel. The benchmark fell $1.34 on Monday.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia said overnight it would cut production by a further 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, slashing its total production to 7.5 million bpd, down nearly 40% from April.</p>
<p>“This reduction in production provided excellent optics encouraging other OPEC+ members to comply and even offer additional voluntary cuts, which should quicken the global oil markets’ rebalancing act,” Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp, said in a note. OPEC+ is a group comprised of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia.</p>
